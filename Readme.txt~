(I have used Lispbox IDE)
After installing lisp, load the file :

(load "slitherlink.lisp")

then call the function slither:

(slither)

When asks Which game do you want to play? type:

tboard1.txt 
tboard2.txt 
and so on..

(All data files should be in UNIX format(Notepad++ > Open file > Edit > EOL conversion > UNIX format))

A. If the user wants to play:
When prompted with the question "Your move? :" the user places moves as follows:

1 1 t

1 1 b

1 2 t

1 2 r

and so on..


Finally when the loop is completed correctly a message will be prompted:
loop complete
You Won!



B. Automatic Play (If the user wants the the computer to solve the game):
When prompted with the question "Your move? :" type: 

solve    (and press enter)


This will be prompted:
apply-hints or solve-anyway?
What do you choose? :

type: apply-hints (if you want the hints to be applied)

type: solve-anyway (for the program to solve the board)
